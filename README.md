# Introduction

Hello, my name is Manuel Pagoada, and this is the portfolio of my notes and tools I use. I am currently enrolled in Google's Cybersecurity courses to prepare for the CompTIA Security+ certification. This will be the place where I document all my notes and any projects I may work on.

I am also a graduate of California State University, East Bay, where I was enrolled in their Security and Information course. I will be uploading my past work here as well and reviewing it as I go. 

Tools I frequently use include **Wireshark**, **IPSec**, and more.

As I progress through this project, I will update this repository so that there is a clearer understanding of what’s going on.

I believe some of my greatest strengths are my curiosity and resilience. I am always ready to learn more, and I do not give up without a fight. I value privacy and the protection of personal data.

After earning my degree, I realized just how much of the internet and computing world is held together by "super glue and duct tape." In a way, I pulled back the veil that once made computer science feel so mysterious. I want to help people who may not realize they're being taken advantage of or whose data is at risk.

Some of my own family members have unknowingly given up personal information, leading to serious consequences. Having to step up and help them made me realize how vulnerable people can be—and how a small crack in the system can lead to significant damage. I'm pursuing a career in cybersecurity to do my best to prevent this from happening to others in the future.
