# Introduction

Hello, my name is Manuel Pagoada, and this is the portfolio of my notes and tools I use. I am currently enrolled in Google's Cybersecurity courses to prepare for the CompTIA Security+ certification. This will be the place where I document all my notes and any projects I may work on.

I am also a graduate of California State University, East Bay, where I was enrolled in their Security and Information course. I will be uploading my past work here as well and reviewing it as I go. 

Tools I frequently use include **Wireshark**, **IPSec**, and more.

As I progress through this project, I will update this repository so that there is a clearer understanding of whatâ€™s going on.
